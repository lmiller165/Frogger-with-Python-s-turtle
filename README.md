Special thanks to: 
Inhye Baik for taking the time to review my code, provide valuable feedback, and share her experiences as a Hackbrighter. 
Danielle Yasso for grabbing a coffee with me to share her experiences both as a Hackbrighter and the five years since she completeing the program. 


The original plan for my prep course project was building the game of pong. In the end I was able to do so with help from this tutorial. Afterwards I wanted to build a program that felt more like mine and was able to repurpose the concepts I learned from building python to build the frogger game.
